# Propser Loan Data Study

This is a deep dive into financial data with a focus on borrower metrics such as loan amounts, delinquencies and loan categories.

I have found tha tworking with financial data was both difficult yet extremely interesting. The full dataset has about 81 different
variables so if you do decide to follow along, you're in for a pleasant surprise with this one.

The only tool used here was python and the related packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn` and `matplotlib.` You might see some
additional html in the notebook code, this is simply for formatting the data tables to look a certain way, it's not really necessary,
but you're free to copy the code if you'd like to use it in your workbooks.

The main prupose of this particular study was to learn how to create presentations with Jupyter, so there should be a html file that converts
slides for a prettier output of the entire report.
